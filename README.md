scripts I have made to make my time on imvu easier and more fun, -rolls eyes-

imvuinstaller - My command line imvu client upgrader and downgrader
checkimvu - checks for latest imvu client software available
wipeimvucache - imvu changes the cache so much and it bogs down my client, they made folders from 00 to ff this is a quick script to wipe that damn cache

more to come I write a lot of bash scripts to make things easier.
